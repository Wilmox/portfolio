# Unity 3D Engine

# Planets & Star(s)
The planets are made with a sphere 3D object. These have their own material, texture & lighting.

# Orbits
When you press the **O**-key on your keyboard, the orbits of each planet will show. This is made with a linerenderer based on the center (the Sun).

# Velocity
If you use the **scrollwheel**, you can change the velocity at which you travel through the Solar System. The velocity is measured in **C**. 1 C equals the speed of light in a vaccuum (in space).
