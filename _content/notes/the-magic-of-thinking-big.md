# Believe you can succeed and you will

 _Develop the power of belief_

* Think success, don’t think failure
* Remind yourself you’re better than you think you are
* Believe big: Little goals, little achievements
# Cure yourself of excusitis, the failure disease

_"My health isn’t good” _

* Refuse to worry/talk about your health + be grateful for good health

_“My brains aren’t good to succeed” _

* We underestimate our own brainpower and overestimate others’s
* The ability to think is much greater value than the ability to memorize facts. Make history, don’t record it

_“Too young/old” _

* 20yrs-70yrs are your productive years, invest time in what you really want to do

_“Bad luck”_

* Other’s luck = preparation, planning. Don’t be a wishful thinker.
# Build confidence and destroy fear

Isolate fear, then take action (ex. Fear of failing exams -> convert worry time into study time)

Deposit only positive thoughts in your memory bank, withdraw only positive ones

Put people in perspective:

* Get a balanced view over a person: “We’re just two important people sitting down”
* Develop an understanding attitude: Try to understand why someone is doing something, “Underneath he’s probably a very nice guy, most folks are”

Build confidence

* Be a front seater
* Make eye contact
* Walk 25% faster
* Practice speaking up
* Smile big
# How to think big

Think about what you have that successful people don’t have (you are bigger than you think)



* Use big, positive, cheerful word and phrases to describe how you feel
* Use bright, cheerful words and phrases to describe other people
* Use positive language to encourage others (Give more compliments)
* Use positive words to outline plans to others

Think what can be, not just what is.



* Practice adding value to things and people (What can I do to add value for that person/thing)
* Practice adding value to yourself
* Stretch your vision

Big thinking:



* Good speech: knowledge and desire of speech > “Don’t let see your notes”, “Don’t make mistakes”,... (Think about things that REALLY matter)
* Quarrels: 99% is avoidable and irrelevant, “Is it really important?”
* Keep your eye focused on the big objectives
# How to think and dream creatively

When you believe, your mind finds ways to do.

Tradition thinking -> “It’s been like this for … years” “Why risk a change” (P121-122)



* Welcome new ideas
* Be an experimental person (try new things)
* Develop an intrest in other elements of your work -> prepares for higher function

## Strengthen your creativity by listening



* Encourage others to talk “Tell me your experience”, “What do you think?”, …
* Tell your own views in the form of a question: “What do you think …”
* Concentrate on what the other person is saying (Evaluate it, ask questions, ...)

## Creative thinking



* BELIEVE
* Don’t let tradition paralyze your mind
* “How can i do better?”
* “How can i do more?”
* Practice asking AND listening
* Stretch your mind
# You are what you think you are

**Look** important, it helps you think important.
Pay more on quality clothing, buy half of your usual amount of clothing
Think your work is important (building cathedral) -> gives mental signals to do work better.

# Manage your environment: Go First Class
* Be environment-conscious
* Make your enviroment work for you
* Don’t let small-thinkers hold you back
* Get advice from people who know.
* Get psychological sunshine (new groups, discover new things)
* Throw poison out of your environment, avoid gossip, talk positive
* Go first in everything you do
# Make your Attitudes your allies

Grow the attitude of:

* “I’m activated & activate others”
* “You are important”
* “Service first”

Be more enthusiastic:

* Dig into it deeper: more knowledge about something = intrest
* In everything you do, life it up
* Broadcast good news

Grow the “You are important” attitude:

* Practice appreciation
* Make people feel important
* Practice calling people by their names
* Don’t take all the credit/glory, invest it instead

Put service first, money later

# Think right toward people

Be more likeable:

* Learn to remember names
* Be a comfortable person
* Acquire the quality of relaxed easy-going
* Don’t be egotistical (Guard against the impression that you know it all)
* Be more interested in other people
* Study to get the scratchy elements out of your personality
* Attempt to heal, every misunderstanding you have had, drains you
* Practice liking people until you do so genuinely
* Never miss an opportunity to say a word of congratulations upon an achievement
* Give spiritual strength to people

Win friends:

* Introduce yourself to others at every possible opportunity
* Be sure the other person gets your name straight
* Remember names
* Stay in touch with “new” friends
* Say pleasant things to strangers
* Recognize that no one is perfect
* Everyone has a right to be different
* Don’t be a reformer (keep negative opinions for yourself)
* Don’t blame others for setbacks

# Get the action habit
* Be an activationist
* Don’t wait until the conditions are perfect
* Ideas alone don’t bring success
* Start you mental engine manually
* Think in terms of NOW. Not tomorrow or next week, …
* Get down to business. Don’t waste time.
* Follow every initiative

# How to turn defeat into Victory
* Study setbacks to pave your way to success. When you lose, learn, win next time
* Seek out your own faults and correct them
* Stop blaming luck. Research your own luck
* Blend persistence with experimentation: Stay with goal but try new approaches, experiment
* There is a good side to every situation

# Use goals to help you grow
