# The Challenge of the Future

When we think about the future, we hope for a futre of progress. That progress can take one of two forms

**Horizontal or extensive progress** is easy to imagine because we already know how it looks like. An other word for horizontal progress is *globalization* - taking tings that work somewher and making them work everywhere.

**Vertical or intensive progress** means doing new things. This is harder to imagine becasuse it requires doing something nobody else has ever done. The single word for vertical progress is *technology*.

> Most people think that the future of the world will be defined by globalisation, but the truth is that technology matters more.

## Startup Thinking

Startups operate on the pronciple that you need to work with other people to get stuff done, but you also need to stay small enough so that you actually can. Positively defined, a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future.

A new company's most important strength is new thinking: even more important than nimbleness, small size affords space to think.
